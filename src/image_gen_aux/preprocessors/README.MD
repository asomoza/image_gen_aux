# Preprocessors

Preprocessors in this context refer to the application of machine learning models to images or groups of images as a preliminary step for other tasks. A common use case is to feed preprocessed images into a controlnet to guide the generation of a diffusion model. Examples of preprocessors include depth maps, normals, and edge detection.

## Supported preprocessors

This is a list of the currently supported preprocessors.

### How to use

```python
from image_gen_aux import LineArtPreprocessor
from image_gen_aux.utils import load_image

input_image = load_image(
    "https://huggingface.co/datasets/OzzyGT/testing-resources/resolve/main/simple_upscale/hippowaffle.png"
)

lineart_preprocessor = LineArtPreprocessor.from_pretrained("OzzyGT/lineart").to("cuda")
image = lineart_preprocessor(input_image)
image.save("lineart.png")
```

Use the Hugging Face Hub model id, a URL, or a local path to load a model. You can also load pickle checkpoints, but it's not recommended due to the [vulnerabilities](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) of pickled files. Loading [safetensor](https://hf.co/docs/safetensors/index) files is a more secure option.

If the checkpoint has custom imports (high risk!), you'll need to set the `weights_only` argument to `False`.

You can also specify a `filename` and a `subfolder` if needed.

```python
lineart_preprocessor = LineArtPreprocessor.from_pretrained("lllyasviel/Annotators", filename="sk_model.pth", weights_only=False).to("cuda")
```
