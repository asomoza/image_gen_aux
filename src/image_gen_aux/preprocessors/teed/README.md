# TEED: Tiny and Efficient Model for the Edge Detection Generalization

Tiny and Efficient Edge Detector (TEED) is a light convolutional neural network with only 58K parameters,
less than 0.2% of the state-of-the-art models. Training on the BIPED dataset takes less than 30 minutes,
with each epoch requiring less than 5 minutes. Our proposed model is easy to train and it quickly converges
within very first few epochs, while the predicted edge-maps are crisp and of high quality, see image above.
